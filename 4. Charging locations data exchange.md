## Charging locations data exchange

### Request
The eMSP will send a request to the Operator in order to fetch a series of charge locations and EVSEs given a number of search criteria. 

Available search criteria:

| Criteria              | Optional | Possible values                                     | 
|:--------------------- | -------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| area                  | o | GPS coordinates of NW and SE corners                       |
| operators             | o | List of codes of the operator(s) to get charge points for |
| vehicleType           | o | Type of vehicle to get charge points for (Car,Bike,Boat) |
| authorizationType     | o | Charge points with certain type(s) of authorisation |

No Criteria will return all charge points. 

A combination of the search criteria is allowed and will be intepreted as an AND query, thus limiting the results.

Additional parameters specify requests on the way the response is given. 

 * language : ask to only return a specific language
 
Coordinates are noted as northwest to southeast corner.
 
All object fields are optional, when multiple fields are noted, they work in 'AND' mode so it will limit the search results.         
 
Note: In [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org) the correct coordinate order is longitude, latitude (X, Y) within coordinate arrays. This differs from many Geospatial APIs (e.g., Google Maps) that generally use the colloquial latitude, longitude (Y, X).

### Response
#### Main structure format

	{
		"locations": Location[],
		"evses": EVSE[]
	}

A charging point information exchange message consists of two parts:
- an array of Location objects
- an array of EVSE objects

	
#### Location objects

The *Location* object describes the location and its properties where a group of EVSE's that belong together are installed. Typically the *Location* object is the exact location of the group of EVSE's, but it can also be the entrance of a parking garage which contains these EVSE's. The exact way to reach each EVSE can then be further specified by its own properties.

A *Location* without valid *EVSE* objects can be considered as expired and should no longer be displayed.

      }
    ]
  }
```

##### Description

The opening hours will be expressed in local time and based on [OCHP](https://github.com/e-clearing-net/OCHP/blob/master/OCHP.md), but using JSON format. The reason why it's because it has been decided iCalendar it's too complex. The idea we pretend to cover with this is that the availability of the connector can be shown in real time to the user.

###### Example 

Operating on Weekdays from 8am till 8pm with one exceptional opening on
22/6/2014 and one exceptional closing the Monday after:

```json 
  "operatingTimes": {
    "regularHours": [
      {
        "weekday": 1,
        "periodBegin": "08:00",

      },
      {
        "weekday": 2,
        "periodBegin": "08:00",
        "periodEnd": "20:00"
      },
      {
        "weekday": 3,
        "periodBegin": "08:00",
        "periodEnd": "20:00"
      },
      {
        "weekday": 4,

      }
    ]
  }
```

This represents the following schedule, where ~~stroked out~~ days are without operation hours, **bold** days are where exceptions apply and regular displayed days are where the regular schedule applies.

#### EVSE objects

The *EVSE* object describes the part that controls the power supply to a single EV in a single session. It always belongs to a *Location* object. It will only contain directions to get from the location to the EVSE (i.e. *floor*, *physical_number* or *directions*). When these properties are insufficient to reach the EVSE from the *Location* point, then it typically indicates that this EVSE should be put in a different *Location* object (sometimes with the same address but with different coordinates/directions).

An *EVSE* object has a list of connectors which can not be used simultaneously: only one connector per EVSE may be used at a time. The list of connectors is seen as atomic. This implies that for any changes or updates to a single connector, the full list of all connectors will have to be specified. Any connector not on that list is considered as deleted.

##### Format

    {
        "id": required string,
        "location_id": required string,
        "status": required enum Status,
        "capabilities": required Capability[],
        "connectors": required Connector[],

        "physical_number": int,
        "directions": string,
        "floor": decimal,

        "valid_from": string,   # ISO 8601 time format
        "valid_until": string   # ISO 8601 time format
    }
    
##### Description:
    
- string **id**: uniquely identifies the EVSE, unlike the location id, the EVSE id must follow the specification of ISO/IEC 15118-2 - Annex H "Specification of Identifiers".
- string **location_id**: the id of the *Location* object that contains this EVSE. If the *Location* object does not exist, this EVSE may be discarded (and it should not have been sent in the first place).
- enum Status **status**: indicates the status of the EVSE
  - AVAILABLE: the EVSE is available to use
  - RESERVED: the EVSE is reserved by someone
  - CHARGING: the EVSE is occupied
  - OUT_OF_SERVICE: the EVSE is currently unavailable
- Capability[] **capabilities**: a list of functionalities that the EVSE is capable of
  - RESERVABLE: the EVSE can be reserved
  - CHARGING_PROFILE_CAPABLE: the EVSE supports Charging Profiles
- Connector[] **connectors**: a list of all available connectors on the EVSE, see the specification for the *Connector* object.
- int *physical_number*: a number on the EVSE for visual identification.
- decimal *floor*: the number of the floor where this EVSE located, typically for parking garages.
- string *directions*: human readable directions when more detailed information on how to reach the EVSE from the *Location* is required.
- string *valid_from*: ISO 8601 formatted timestamp to describe when the EVSE becomes available. When this field is null, the EVSE has been made available.
- string *valid_until*: ISO 8601 formatted timestamp to describe when the EVSE expires. When this field is null, the EVSE is not expired.


#### Connector objects

A connector is the socket available for the EV to make use of. A single EVSE may provide multiple sockets but only one of these sockets can be in use at the same time. A connector always belongs to an *EVSE* object.

##### Format

    {
        "id": required string,
        "type": required enum ConnectorType,
        "charge_protocol": enumeration ChargeProtocolType,
        
        "power_type": required enum PowerType,
        "voltage": required int,
        "amperage": required int,

        "price_schemes": required PricingScheme[],
        "terms_and_contitions": string,  # URL
    }
    
##### Description
    
- string **id**: uniquely identifies the connector within the EVSE. Two connectors may have the same id as long as they do not belong to the same *EVSE* object.
- enum ConnectorType **type**: see *ConnectorType* specification in OCPP2.0
- enum ChargeProtocolType *charge_protocol*: 
  - MODE3
  - CHADEMO
  - ISO15118
  - UNCONTROLLED
- enum PowerType **power_type**:
  - AC_1_PHASE
  - AC_3_PHASE
  - DC
- int **voltage**: voltage of the connector (line to neutral for AC_3_PHASE), in volt [V]
- int **amperage**: maximum amperage of the connector, in ampere [A]
- PricingScheme[] **price_schemes**: list of applicable price schemes (see *PriceScheme* specification in OCPP2.0)
- string *terms_and_contitions*: URL to the operator's terms and conditions

#### Pricing scheme objects

The pricing scheme should be able to be specified for 'all' and/or the specific eMSP. Therefore two different pricing schemes could be sent as maximum and none as minimum: 

##### Format

    {
      	"default": required boolean,
      	"expiry_date": string,  # ISO 8601 time format
      	"start_date": string,  # ISO 8601 time format
      	"tariffs": required Tariffs[],
      	"display_text": DisplayText[]
    }

##### Description

- boolean **default**: flag to indicate if it's the default price. If the CPO has the default information is preferred it is sent as well to an eMSP partner, since it would enable the eMSP to share that default tariff information with consumers of this information that are not customers of this specific eMSP.
- string *expiry_date*: date from which the pricing schemes is not valid any more. It will be expressed in UTC format with no seconds based on ISO8601.
- string *start_date*: date from which the pricing schemes is not valid any more. It will be expressed in UTC format with no seconds based on ISO8601.
- Tariffs[] **tariffs**: 
- DisplayText[] *display_text*: human readable form indicating this scheme

The schema will look as it is specified on OCPP2.0 for now: http://www.openchargealliance.org/sites/default/files/OCPP%202.0%20Release%20Candidate%202.p df page 212 (chapter 10.6). On OCPI it's also indicated currently.

#### Tariff objects 

##### Format

```
	{
  		"currency": required enum Currency,
  		"price_gross": required decimal,
  		"pricing_unit": required enum PricingUnit,
  		"tariff_id": required string,
  		"display_text": DisplayText[]
  	}	
  ```

##### Description

The tariff will exclude VAT for now in this price_schemes. **To be discussed in more detail if would be a a good idea to include it as an optional field(think about international parties)**

- Currency **currency**:  ISO 4217 code for currency
- decimal **price_gross**:  amount (price of the unit excluding tax)
- PricingUnit **pricing_unit**: enumeration of types of pricing (kwhtoev, occupancyhours, charginghours, idlehours, session see OCPP2)
- string **tariff_id**: identifier of this tariff (unique or at least within this schema)
- DisplayText[] *display_text*: human readable form of this part of the tariff

#### Display text objects

They will be used in all the objects sent in this response, since the aim of the protocol is being able to show to the customer information about the charging locations, it is important we allow the operator to express as much as possible the information they want to show to their drivers.

##### Format

	{
		"language": required string,
    	"text": required string
	}

##### Description

- string **language**: language expressed in ISO0639–1 format
- string **text**: text to display

### Message types

#### Synchronisation messages

Synchronisation messages are based on a PULL model: the eMSP pulls the information from the Charge Point Operator. A synchronisation message contains all information of all available locations and EVSE's. Any older information that is not specified in the message is considered as no longer valid. 

Each object must contain all required fields. Fields that are not specified may be considered as null values.

##### Example

#### Update messages

Update messages are based on a PUSH model: the Charge Point Operator notifies the eMSP of changes to any objects. Update messages are similar to synchronisation messages except that only the object id is required. Only the fields that are updated are specified. Any fields or objects that are not specified in the update message are considered unchanged.

##### Example: a simple status update

This is the most common type of update message to notify e-MSP's that an EVSE is now occupied.

```json
	{
		"evses": [
			{
				"id": "BE-BEC-E041503001",
				"status": "occupied",
			}
		]
	}
```


##### Example: advanced update

In this example the name of the location is updated and connector 2 of EVSE *BE-BEC-E041503001* receives a new pricing scheme. Note that since the connectors property is atomic, we also have to specify the information for connector 1. 

```json
	{
		"locations": [
			{
				"id": "LOC1",
				"name": "Interparking Gent Zuid",
			}
		],
		"evses": [
			{
				"id": "BE-BEC-E041503001",
				"status": "available",
				"connectors": [
					{
						"id": "1",
						"type": "cType2",
						"price": PRICINGSCHEMES
					},
					{
						"id": "2",
						"type": "sType2",
						"price": NEW_PRICINGSCHEMES
					}
				]
			}
		]
	}
```
	
##### Example: add an EVSE

To add an *EVSE* or a *Location*, simply put the full object in an update message, including all its required fields. Since the id is new, the receiving party will know that it is a new object. The new object should be processed in the same way as in a synchronisation message. When not all required fields are specified, the object may be discarded.

```json
	{
		"evses": [
			{
				"evse_id": "BE-BEC-E041503003",
				"location_id": "LOC1",

				"status": "available",
				"capabilities": ["reservable"],

				"connectors": [
					{
						"id": "1",
						"type": "sType2",
						"price_schemes": [
							
						]
					}
				],
				
				"physical_number": 3,
				"floor": -1,
				
				"valid_from": "2015-05-21T10:00:00+0200"
			}
		]
	}
```

##### Example: delete an EVSE

An EVSE can be deleted by updating its *valid_until* property.

```json
	{
		"evses": [
			{
				"id": "BE-BEC-E041503001",
				"valid_until": "2015-04-27T13:00:00+0200"
			}
		]
	}
```
