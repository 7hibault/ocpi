TO BE UPDATED.

The interfaces are protected on HTTP transport level, with SSL and Basic Authentication. Please note that this mechanism does **not** require client side certificates for authentication, only server side certificates in order to setup a secure SSL connection. 
More information on basic authentication is found at the [IETF](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617#page-5) See http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617#page-5
