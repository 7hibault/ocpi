### Overview

### Charging topology

The charging topology, as relevant to the eMSP, consists of three entities:

* *Connector* is a specific socket or cable available for the EV to make use of.
* *EVSE* is the part that controls the power supply to a single EV in a single session. An EVSE may provide multiple connectors but only one of these can be active at the same time.
* *Location* is a group of one or more EVSE's that belong together geographically.

### Timestamps

All timestamps are formatted using the combined date and time format from the ISO 8601 standard. The absence of the timezone designator implies a UTC timestamp.

Example:
    
    2015-06-29T22:39:09+00:00

### Variable names

In order to prevent issues with Capitals in variable names, the naming in JSON is not CamelCase but camel_case. All variables are lowercase and include an underscore for a space.
