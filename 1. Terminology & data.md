## Terminology and Data

 * **OCPI** Open Charge Point Interface 
 * **NDR** Notification Detail Record
 * **CDR** Charge Detail Record
 * **CPO** Charging Platform Operator
 * **eMSP** e-Mobility Service Provider

### Overview

### Charging topology

The charging topology, as relevant to the eMSP, consists of three entities:

* *Connector* is a specific socket or cable available for the EV to make use of.
* *EVSE* is the part that controls the power supply to a single EV in a single session. An EVSE may provide multiple connectors but only one of these can be active at the same time.
* *Location* is a group of one or more EVSE's that belong together geographically or spatially.

A Location is typically the exact location of one or more EVSE's, but it can also be the entrance of a parking garage or a gated community. It is up to the CPO to use whatever makes the most sense in a specific situation. Once arrived at the location, any further instructions to reach the EVSE from the Location are stored in the EVSE object itself (such as the floor number, visual identification or manual instructions).

### Timestamps

All timestamps are formatted as strings using the combined date and time format from the ISO 8601 standard. The absence of the timezone designator implies a UTC timestamp.


Example:
    
    2015-06-29T22:39:09+00:00

### Variable names

In order to prevent issues with Capitals in variable names, the naming in JSON is not CamelCase but camel_case. All variables are lowercase and include an underscore for a space.
