## Introduction and background
The Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI) enables a scalable, automated EV roaming setup between Charge Point Operators and e-Mobility Service Providers. It supports authorisation, charge point information exchange (incl transaction events), charge detail record exchange and finally, the exchange of smart-charging commands between parties.

It offers market participants in EV an attractive and scalable solution for (international) roaming between networks, avoiding the costs and innovation-limiting complexities involved with today's non-automated solutions or with central roaming hubs. 

As such it helps to enable EV drivers to charge everywhere in a fully-informed way, helps the market to develop quickly and helps market players to execute their business models in the best way.

Starting in 2009, e-laad foundation and the forerunner of the eViolin association specified 2 standards in order to retrieve charge point details and active state. These are called the VAS interface and the Amsterdam interface. In this same period, a CDR format for the exchange of charge sessions between eViolin members was defined. This format is currently in use by the majority of the eViolin members. 

Recently, eViolin started combining these interfaces, extending them with, amongst others, pricing information and transaction events (NDR's), resulting in a first version of the OCPI interface. 

This document describes a combined set of standards based on the work done in the past. Next to that, the evolution of these standards and their use is taken into account and some elements have been updated to match nowadays use.
