## JSON / HTTP implementation guide

### Interface endpoint locations
As OCPI contains multiple interfaces, different endpoints are available for messaging. 
The interfaces endpoints should use the following as a reference:  

| Operator interface         | Endpoint            | Method              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------|
| Registrations              | /ocpi/registrations | POST/PUT/DELETE     |
| Charging location details  | /ocpi/locations     | GET                 | - Static data
| Commands                   | /ocpi/commands      | POST                | 
| Smart Charging             | /ocpi/smartcharging | POST                | - Charging profiles requests


| eMSP interface             | Endpoint            | Method              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Registrations              | /ocpi/registrations | POST/PUT/DELETE     |
| Charging location updates  | /ocpi/locations     | POST/PUT            | - Charge location/evses updates (e.g. status)
| Sessions                   | /ocpi/sessions      | POST                | - Details about a session initiated by a customer of that eMSP
| CDRs                       | /ocpi/cdrs          | POST                | 
| Smart Charging             | /ocpi/smartcharging | POST                | - Responses to Charging profiles requests (e.g. ChargingProfileAccepted)

The interfaces are dynamically specified during the registration calls and don't need a standard location, but the registration interface details should have been shared previously between the parties.

### A note on error responses

When a request cannot be accepted, an HTTP error response code is expected including a JSON object that contains more details. 
HTTP status codes are described on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)

The content that is sent with all the response messages is a 'application/json' type and contains a JSON object:

```json
{
	"status_code": 100, 
	"timestamp": ,
	"data" : {
		...
	}
}
```
- status_code: This codes are defined in the Status codes chapter
- timestamp: Time when the message was generated, we don't have an use for this yet but might be useful if any party comes offline and sends a bunch of messages at once or even debugging purposes
