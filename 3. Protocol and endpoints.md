## JSON / HTTP implementation guide

The OCPI protocol is based on HTTP and uses the JSON format. It follows a RESTful architecture for webservices where possible.

### Interface endpoint locations

As OCPI contains multiple interfaces, different endpoints are available for messaging. The protocol is designed such that the exact URI's of the endpoints can be defined by each party. The locations of endpoints can be retrieved by fetching the API information from the root endpoint. It is strongly recommended to insert the protocol version into the URI. 

For example: `/ocpi/cpo/v1/locations` and `/ocpi/emsp/v1/locations`.

The URI's of the endpoints in this document are descriptive only. The interfaces endpoints should use the following as a reference:  

| Operator interface         | Endpoint                | Method               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------|
| API info (endpoints)       | /ocpi/cpo/              | GET                  |
| Credentials                | /ocpi/cpo/credentials   | POST/PUT/DELETE      |
| Charging location details  | /ocpi/cpo/locations     | GET                  | - Static data
| Commands                   | /ocpi/cpo/commands      | POST                 | 
| Smart Charging             | /ocpi/cpo/smartcharging | POST                 | - Charging profiles requests


| eMSP interface             | Endpoint                 | Method              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| API info (endpoints)       | /ocpi/emsp/              | GET                 |
| Credentials                | /ocpi/emsp/credentials   | POST/PUT/DELETE     |
| Charging location updates  | /ocpi/emsp/locations     | POST/PUT            | - Charge location/evses updates (e.g. status)
| Sessions                   | /ocpi/emsp/sessions      | POST                | - Details about a session initiated by a customer of that eMSP
| CDRs                       | /ocpi/emsp/cdrs          | POST                | 
| Smart Charging             | /ocpi/emsp/smartcharging | POST                | - Responses to Charging profiles requests (e.g. ChargingProfileAccepted)


### Authentication

Each request must add an 'Authorization' HTTP header. The header looks as following:

```
    Authorization: Token IpbJOXxkxOAuKR92z0nEcmVF3Qw09VG7I7d/WCg0koM=
```

### Initial registration

To register a CPO in a eMSP platform (or vice versa), the CPO must create a unique token that can be used for authenticating the eMSP. This token along with the API info endpoint will have to be sent to the eMSP in some secure way that is outside the scope of this protocol.

See the `/ocpi/?` and `/ocpi/?/credentials` endpoint API for more details.

### A note on error responses

When a request cannot be accepted, an HTTP error response code is expected including a JSON object that contains more details. 
HTTP status codes are described on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)

The content that is sent with all the response messages is a 'application/json' type and contains a JSON object:

```json
{
	"status_code": 100, 
	"timestamp": "2015-06-30T21:59:59Z",
	"data" : {
		...
	}
}
```
- status_code: This codes are defined in the Status codes chapter
- timestamp: Time when the message was generated, we don't have a use for this yet but might be useful if any party comes offline and sends a bunch of messages at once or even debugging purposes


## API information endpoint

 `/ocpi/cpo/` and `/ocpi/emsp`


| Method   | Description                                                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET      | Fetch information about the supported versions, features and endpoints. |
